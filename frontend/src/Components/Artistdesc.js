                        India. 
                        Indian is often considered as the epitome of rich culture and art. India has been the focal point of many famous art forms whose popularity extended beyond the country.
            Almost every religion has its traditional art which spans from drawing, embroideries, paintings, sculpting, saris, dances and many more.
           Because of technological advancement India is now on the verge of becoming one of the world’s superpowers. As a result of this India is failing to take care of and restore our old art forms
           and the artists are choosing other professions to earn their livelihood.

                    <p class="h5" >
                        Artists are important for several reasons. They provide a way of understanding and interpreting the world around us.
                        They allow us to see the world from a different perspective and to appreciate the beauty in things that we might otherwise overlook.
                        Artists help us to see the world differently.
                        They offer new perspectives and ways of looking at familiar things. Their work can challenge our assumptions and open our eyes to new possibilities.
                        Artists can also help us to understand ourselves better. Their work often reflects the human condition and can provide insight into our own emotions and experiences. By looking at the world through an artist’s eyes,
                        we can gain a new understanding and how we all fit into the world around us.
                        Artists often challenge the status quo and push us to think outside the box. They can bring change in the world by giving us a new way of looking at things.
                        Infact, many of the most remarkable changes in history have been brought in by artists.
                        Artists connect us to our history. They help us to understand who we are and where we come from.Their work records our past and a window into our future. They leave a legacy for future generations.
                        The artwork left by our ancestors can give us a glimpse into their lives and how they saw the world. It can help us to understand our own culture and traditions.

                            <p class="h5">Funding can be a primary issue within the arts, and if you’re financially able, do consider donating.
                                 By making a donation to your local arts charity or fund, you can contribute to the support of artists and arts organisations
                                 immensely. Such gestures can aid this industry by providing individuals and smaller institutions with the resources they need
                                 for artistic production, programming, residencies, exhibitions, and much more.</p>

                            <p class="h5">A major way to support the arts is to regularly attend exhibitions and openings at your local galleries. However, as many of us
                                 carry out social distancing measures during this time, many arts institutions and galleries have moved their exhibitions online through virtual galleries and online viewing rooms. Showing up to an exhibition - even virtually - can be a very cultural and educational experience. It also goes a long way to showcase support to your fellow local artists and arts community.
                                 Google Arts and Culture features content from over 2,000 leading museums and galleries on their platform. They have also partnered with various institutions to showcase their exhibitions online, where you can even view and virtually enter some of the most prestigious museums around the world - right from your own living room. Check them out here.
                                 Art fairs and festivals are even moving online, such as the Virtual Design Festival. Launching on 15 April, this will be the very first online architecture and design festival that will include contributions from major designers, instututions and brands around the world.</p>
