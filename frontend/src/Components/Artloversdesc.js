                            Although we talk a lot about the artist-fan relationship, the value of that connection extends to the rest of an artist’s team as well.
                            It’s the fans who have bought billboards, planted trees, and have been very active on social media. Without fans, artist teams wouldn’t have 
                            the funding that comes from record, merch, and ticket sales.
                            The fans are a huge part of an artist’s team. They are the ones who take in all of the content from the artist, whether that be promotional stories, music, videos, etc.. Fans contribute a tremendous amount of support financially, creatively, and promotionally, which is why it is so important for artists 
                            to understand their fan bases and connect with them.

                            eKalakaar.com promotes the traditional performing art by democratising the art, wherein the artists
                            have quality of life and dignity.
                            
       Art fans can contribute to the art world in a variety of ways. They can share their artwork with others, either on social media or in galleries, to inspire others and start conversations about art. They can also purchase art from artists and help them to make a living from their craft. Art fans can also volunteer with local art organizations, such as museums or non-profits, to help promote and spread awareness of art. Additionally, art fans can volunteer their services to teach art classes or offer workshops in their local community. This can help people to learn more about the art world,
      and help to create a more diverse and inclusive environment for art.
