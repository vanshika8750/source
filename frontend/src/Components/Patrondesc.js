                    <p class="h5 mt-3">When it comes to sponsoring the arts, corporate partnerships are a mainstay. Many believe that companies engage in this type
                         of support because of the fundamental value that the arts bring to a community. However, the reasoning behind corporate sponsorship of
                          the arts goes far beyond just that goal. When a company invests in the arts, it is in fact working toward ensuring its own financial 
                          health and success as a business. At the end of the day, sponsoring the arts builds business. Let's take a look at how this works.
                     </p>
                        <ul class="text-start h5 mt-3" style={{"text-decoration": "none","margin-left": "20px"}}>
                            <li><strong>Financial Impact Of The Arts.</strong></li>
                            <p class="h5">
                                To understand how the arts and cultural industries build business in their communities, we need to have a good understanding of
                                the financial impact of the arts. According to a report, U.S. arts and cultural economic activity had impressive growth in 2016,
                                adding about $60 billion more to the U.S. economy than the construction industry added. In the same year, the arts industry contributed
                                nearly five times more to the American economy than the agricultural sector did.
                                Those facts alone should be eye-openers, but add to that the realization that the $804 billion the arts contributed to the U.S. GDP in 2016
                                is more than half of the entire GDP of Canada or Russia. The GDP for Canada was $1.536 trillion in 2016, while in Russia it stood at $1.285 trillion.
                                What’s more, the financial impact of the arts on the U.S. economy is more than the entire 2016 GDP for countries such as Saudi Arabia ($645 billion),
                                Switzerland ($669 billion) or the Netherlands ($777 billion). It’s been said that the arts mean big business, but the facts show that the arts mean huge 
                                business.

                            <p class="h5">
                                Community leaders have been leveraging the economic power of the arts and creative industries to revitalize rural communities.
                                The National Governors Association, working in partnership with national arts agencies, published "Rural Prosperity Through the
                                Arts & Creative Sector: A Rural Action Guide for Governors and States" to help rural communities overcome economic challenges 
                                specific to their areas, such as outmigration, lack of educational opportunities and lack of infrastructure. The guidebook provides
                                suggestions for helping these communities thrive by offering action plans that assist them in growing and harnessing their own arts and cultural assets.
                                Just to sum that up: The National Governors Association is giving states proven strategies for economically disadvantaged rural
                                areas that will build businesses and create economic opportunities to thrive by partnering with the arts.

                            <li><strong>The Effect Of The Arts In Metro Areas.</strong></li>
                            <p class="h5">
                                Public art installations have been used in beautification programs for cities and towns. They are not just an important part of a plan to make the areas look better; they can also boost a city's growth.

The more a city has to offer, the more competitive it will be in attracting conventions and employers. Public art adds to the walkability of a city around event centers and helps make the city more distinguished in the eyes of meeting and event planners. Public art has a direct impact on not only how visitors view a city, but how residents view it. According to a public opinion survey, 60% of participants believe that the "arts improve the image and identity" of their community. Leveraging public art and cultural corridors to attract events also helps local businesses profit when those events do come to town.

The survey also shows that people perceive the arts as having a vital role in driving the health and the prosperity of a community. This example shows that arts and cultural organizations truly have the ability to build communities and add significantly to their overall stability, wealth and resources. Promoting the arts can also affect companies that support these organizations by impacting their bottom line in a positive way.

Corporate Visionaries Lead The Way

In 2018, North American sponsorship in the arts broke the $1 billion mark for the first time. The No. 1 business sector supporting the arts was the banking industry. After the banking industry, the next two biggest sponsors of the arts were professional services and financial services. These categories include, but are not limited to, professions such as lawyers, management consultants, investment brokers and accounting firms. The fourth-largest industry sponsoring the arts was the insurance industry.

These industries are not supporting the arts solely to give back to the community. They also do it because their work with these cultural organizations has a positive impact on their own business and company culture. As I wrote in a previous article, companies today are increasingly rated by their community involvement, ethics and social responsibility. Many corporate visionaries see the value of deeper cultural engagement and being connected to the community. Such engagement opens the opportunities for companies to stand out in the eyes of consumers, employees and investors. It’s also a way to stand out from the competition.

Partnerships with the arts not only help support the community, but they are also smart, proactive steps to building better business.

                            Every state of the country has several traditional performing arts. Now-a-days, the artists
                            particularly
                            youth are less interested as neither there is respect/ acceptance/ appreciation of the art
                            nor they are
